# Game-Theory
This project delves into two game theory scenarios: the Resource Allocation Challenge, focusing on optimal water distribution strategies, and Monopoly vs. Competition, analyzing market dynamics between a monopolist and potential entrants. By applying game theory concepts like Nash Equilibrium and dominant strategies, this project aims to understand strategic decision-making in resource management and market competition, identify optimal strategies, analyze equilibrium points, and evaluate the impact of competition on resource distribution and market dynamics. The findings will provide theoretical insights, practical implications, and potential policy recommendations for efficient resource management and fair market competition.
